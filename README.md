Welcome to the JuggleFit website, a platform for a revolutionary sport-juggling competition. JuggleFit aims to create a motivating, fair, and exciting competition that measures juggling skill through control over specific tricks, with minimal preparation required. This website serves as the hub for event information, route creation, and community engagement.

This repository contains the source code for the JuggleFit website, built using Flask, Python, and modern web technologies. Whether you're a juggler, event host, or developer, you're welcome to explore, use, or contribute! The site is currently hosted on Render for public access.
